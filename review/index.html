    <h1>Parasite Film Review</h1>
    <h2>The Premise</h2>
    <p>Described by its creator as “a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains”, Parasite is a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum. We first meet the Kim family, headed by father Ki-taek and mother Chung-sook, in their lowly semi-basement home they have nothing but one another and a shared sense of hard-scrabble entrepreneurism. So when son Ki-woo is faced with an opportunity to home-tutor a rich schoolgirl, he gets his gifted artist sister, Ki-jung, to forge a college certificate, bluffing his way into the job and into the home of the Park family.</p>

    <p>This wealthy house is everything the Kims’ pokey dwelling is not: elegant, angular and weirdly isolated. While aloof businessman Mr Park is at work, his anxious, uptight wife, Yeon-kyo, tends to their daughter and hyperactive young son. Spying an opening, Ki-woo realises that his own family could easily fill roles as servants, and hatches a plan that will ingratiate the Kims into the privileged lives and home of the Parks.</p>
    <h2>Initial Thoughts</h2>
    <p>The Kim family may live in squalor, but they are clearly every bit as smart as, and a lot more united than, the Parks, who turn their noses up at the smell of “people who ride the subway”. Similarly, while the smug Mr Park is habitually depicted ascending the stairs of his ultra-modern home, and the Kims are pictured scampering down city steps to their own underworld apartment, it’s clear who holds the dramatic high ground. When it comes to deception, too, those on the upper rungs of the societal ladder are as practised as those upon whom they look down. In a world of vertical non-integration, Parasite finds depths lurking beneath even the most placid surfaces. Yet Bong is careful to keep his opposing forces keenly balanced, in which the audience is invited to decide for themselves the precise meaning of these strangely symmetrical apparitions.0</p>

    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>For me, Parasite is best described as a ghost story, albeit one disguised beneath layers of superbly designed generic mutations. Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won’s multitonal script, it’s a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul.</p>
