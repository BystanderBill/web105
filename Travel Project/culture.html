            <p>Art is everywhere in France, particularly in Paris and other major cities, and Gothic, Romanesque Rococo and Neoclassic influences can be seen in many churches and other public buildings.</p>
            <p>Many of history's most renowned artists, including Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Camille Pissarro, sought inspiration in Paris, and they gave rise to the Impressionism movement.</p>
            <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris is among the world's largest museums and is home to many famous works of art, including the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo.</p>

           <h2>French Clothing</h2>
           <p>Paris is known as the home to many high-end fashion houses, such as Dior, Hermes, Louis Vuitton and Chanel. Many French people dress in a sophisticated, professional and fashionable style, but it is not overly fussy. Typical outfits include nice dresses, suits, long coats, scarves and berets.</p>
           <p>The term haute couture is associated with French fashion and loosely means fancier garments that are handmade or made to order. In France, the term is protected by law and is defined by the Paris Chamber of Commerce</p>
