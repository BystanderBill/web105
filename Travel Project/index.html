               <p> The myth that everything in Europe shuts down in August is not a myth at all and totally happens, especially in countries like Italy, Spain, and you guessed it, France.</p>
               <p> Most locals leave for vacation this month, and many restaurants and small businesses stay closed for weeks at a time. But truthfully, every month in Paris has its perks even August, if avoiding large crowds of Parisians actually sounds appealing to you.</p>
               <p> Winters aren’t too cold, and Paris during Christmas time is straight out of a movie. And of course, Paris in the springtime is hard to beat.</p>

           <h2>Visiting Paris</h2>
           <p>When it comes to romance, Paris has that special je ne sais quoi that captivates millions of visitors day in and day out.</p>
           <p>The City of Lights isn’t exactly a walk in the park -- a challenging language and intimidating Parisians can make for an overwhelming experience, especially if this is your first time in Europe.</p>
           <p>The best way to see Paris is simply by strolling through it. It’s incredibly difficult to get lost. There are 20 different neighborhoods, and every single street sign in the entire city denotes which one you’re in. The city’s neighborhoods are organized in the shape of a counterclockwise snail; find the 1st arrondissement on a map and count to 20, moving your finger in a counterclockwise, circular motion.</p>
