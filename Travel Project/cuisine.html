                <img src="fries.jpg" alt="french fries" id="pic2">
                <p>French Fries, interestingly enough, may not be French.</p> 
                <p>According to National Geographic, they may actually be from Spain or Belgium.</p>
                <p>The reason why Americans call fried potatoes French Fries is because Thomas Jefferson discovered the treat while in France while serving there as American Minister from 1784 to 1789 and he brought the idea back to the States.</p>

           <h2>Food in France</h2>
           <p>Food and wine are central to life at all socioeconomic levels, and much socializing is done around lengthy dinners.</p> 
           <p>While cooking styles have changed to emphasize lighter fare, many still associate French cooking with heavy sauces and complicated preparation.</p> 
           <p>Some classic French dishes include boeuf bourguignon; a stew made of beef braised in red wine, beef broth and seasoned with garlic, onions and mushrooms, and coq au vin, a dish made with chicken, Burgundy wine, lardons (small strips or cubes of pork fat), button mushrooms, onions and optional garlic.</p>
