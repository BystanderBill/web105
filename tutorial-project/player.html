                        One of the great things about D&D is that you only really need a copy of the rules, some pencils and paper, a set of dice, and your imagination. Wizards of the Coast put a PDF of the basic rules online for free. The best place to start is with the Starter Set. The box includes everything you need to get started: an essential rules handbook, an introductory adventure, five pre-made character sheets, and a set of dice.
                        Players are sometimes disappointed that they don’t get to make their own characters, but all those pre-made character sheets do is get a bunch of math out of the way for you. The personality traits, motivations, and relationships listed on the sheets are meant to serve as inspiration, not hem you in.
                        Of course if you really want to create a character from scratch, you can do that too. The website D&D Beyond offers a character creator tool that can help.
                        The hardcover Player’s Handbook, which covers everything in the Basic Rules with additional character customization options and beautiful art, is good to have at the table to reference spells and abilities while you’re playing.
