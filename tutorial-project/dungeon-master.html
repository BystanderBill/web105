                            The Dungeon Master (DM for short) refers to the player who acts as narrator, antagonist, and guide to the rest of the players in D&D. (In non-D&D games they’re called the Game Master/GM.) According to Wizards of the Coast brand director Nathan Stewart, rule number one for aspiring DMs is “you don’t have to know all the rules.” In fact, he shared a quote from the creator of Dungeons and Dragons, Gary Gygax.
                            “The secret we should never let the game masters know is that they don’t need any rules.”

                    <p>
                        As a new DM, it’s usually easier to run a pre-existing adventure rather than immediately come up with your own story. You certainly don’t have to

                    <p>
                        The adventure included in the Starter Set is called Lost Mines of Phandelver and is a good introduction to how stories work in D&D, as well as its settings and lore. Wizards of the Coast also periodically publishes full campaigns that are either stand-alone adventures or part of a series. These assume that you have a regular group playing together frequently, because campaigns are meant to be played out over several weeks or months.

                        Officially published adventures are only the beginning. D&D is a hobby that is very easily crowdsourced and people publish their own adventures on the internet all the time, many of which are free.
