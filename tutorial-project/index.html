                        <p>
                            The original D&D box, by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, contained three booklets: Men & Magic, Monsters & Treasure, and The Underworld & Wilderness.
                            Men & Magic contained the game's original character classes to play as.
                            Monsters and Treasure, as its name hinted, contains a list of monsters followed by a list of treasures.
                            The Underworld & Wilderness contained reveals the earliest ideas about creating RPG adventures. The first half of the book, which talks about dungeons, shows how to create a beautiful dungeon with complex interconnected levels of the sort that wouldn't come back into vogue until the '80s. It even details a sample level, which was the first published dungeon ever. The idea of wandering monsters also originates here.
                            The other half of the book talks about adventuring in the wilderness.

                    <h2>Why Learn Dungeons and Dragons?</h2>

                    <p>
                        While Dungeons and Dragons is definitely the most popular tabletop roleplaying game, it’s not the only one. There are tons of RPGs with different settings and mythologies. There are Star Wars games, games based on tarot cards, and even a Wet Hot American Summer game. All come in varying levels of rule complexity and structure.

                        Dungeons and Dragons is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum — the rules are simple enough to follow as a beginner, but there’s a very clear structure to work within. Players have room to get creative without feeling paralyzed by infinite choices or bogged down by complicated rules. Unless you’re looking for something extremely specific, I’d recommend starting with D&D and branching out from there once you get the hang of roleplaying.
